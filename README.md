# Facade-Design-Pattern
Façade is one of the most simplest design pattern, and at times I doubt if we should call this a pattern, but as it solves a very important common problem that every developer faces at some point of time, I guess that’s the reason why this is a design pattern.

It is defined as 

“it Provides an unified and SIMPLIFIED interface in a SUBSYSTEM, therefore it hides the COMPLEXITIES of the subsystem from the client”.

it means, if you have a client and a complex class, then façade provides a simplified interface to a complex set of classes.
